# NTHU-Distributed-System

The repository includes modules for the NTHU Distributed System course lab with mono-repo architecture.

Before going through the following parts, make sure your Docker is running since we are generating/testing/building code inside a Docker container to prevent dependencies from conflicting/missing on your host machine.

## Code Generation

Some modules use gRPC for communication or use the `mockgen` library for unit testing.

So there is a need to generate code manually when the code changed.

For generating code for all modules, run `make dc.generate`.

For generating code for a single module, run `make dc.{module}.generate`. For example: `make dc.video.generate`.

## Unit Testing

We implements unit testing through DAO and service layers with [ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) framework.

To run unit testing for all modules, run `make dc.test`.

To run unit testing for a single module, run `make dc.{module}.test`. For example: `make dc.video.test`.

## Style Check

We use [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) for linting.

To run linting for all modules, run `make dc.lint`.

To run linting for a single module, run `make dc.{module}.lint`. For example: `make dc.video.lint`.

## Build Image

To build docker image, run `make dc.image`.

## CI/CD

The CI/CD runs in [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). See [workflow spec](.github/workflows/main.yml) for more details.
